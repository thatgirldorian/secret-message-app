<h3>Issued faced & resolution:</h3>

- I didn't know how to override the color of the autocomplete on my message cards and could not do this via external CSS stylings. However, after a lot of googling, i found a way to do it via internal CSS styling by adding a style properly just under the input tag. It's not the best option, but it works for now.
