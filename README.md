 This is an app that generates a link and lets people send you anonymous messages through that.

<h3>Issued faced & resolution:</h3>

- I didn't know how to override the color of the autocomplete on my message cards and could not do this via external CSS stylings. However, after a lot of googling, I found a way to do it via internal CSS styling by adding a style properly just under the input tag. It's not the best option, but it works for now.


<h3>Technology used:</h3>

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Materialize CSS
- GitHub
- Vercel (used to be Zeit Now)
